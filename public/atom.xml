<p>The <a href="https://onion.io/omega" target="_blank" rel="external">Onion Omega</a> is billed as “an invention platform for the Internet of Things.” It’s a compact module that has WiFi built in and promises to allow hardware prototyping in high level languages like Python and Javascript with NodeJS. After playing with one for several hours here are the 5 things I think you should know if you’re just get started with yours or thinking about ordering one.</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<h2 id="1-_It’s_OpenWrt_Under_the_Hood">1. It’s OpenWrt Under the Hood</h2><p>This isn’t a magical secret but it can definitely be helpful if you’re trying to figure out how to do something not covered in the documentation. The docs on the Omega are still very scarce so if you’re trying to do something beyond getting started you probably won’t find it there. The docs and info on <a href="https://openwrt.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">OpenWrt</a> are aplenty so you’re much more likely to find help if you seek it out in those forums. Google is your friend on this one.</p>
<h2 id="2-_The_Pins_Aren’t_-1”_Spaced">2. The Pins Aren’t .1” Spaced</h2><p>Again, not something that’s hidden but it’s also not super apparent if you are shopping on the website especially if you are a beginner. It’s important to know because that means you can’t just connect it to a breadboard and start prototyping with it. You will definitely need one of the available docks from their website. I recommend the Expansion Dock to get started.</p>
<h2 id="3-_It_Will_Run_on_AA_Batteries">3. It Will Run on AA Batteries</h2><p>There are multiple power options when working with the Omega but there are some things you need to be aware of so you don’t fry it. First of all the operating voltage of the Omega itself is 3.3V so it is NOT 5V tolerant. If you have a Battery Dock you can hook up a 1s LiPo as there is an onboard voltage regulator. The Expansion dock is a little different though. You can power the Omega via the micro USB port however a LiPo won’t work in this scenario. If you connect it to the 3.3V breakout pins you’ll potentially supply up to 4.2V on a full charge which could damage the Omega. That doesn’t mean you’re out of luck for battery power though. Two AA or AAA batteries supply 3V which I confirmed is sufficient to operate the Omega. You just connect the leads up to the 3.3V and GND pins that are on the header like this.</p>

<script async defer src="//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js"></script>

<h2 id="4-_You_Can_Rename_It">4. You Can Rename It</h2><p>When you first set up the Omega you’ll probably connect to it’s access point which is named something like OMEGA-1ACD which means to access it via the browser you’ll use something like <a href="http://omega-1acd.local/" target="_blank" rel="external">http://omega-1acd.local/</a> which is fine but can be hard to remember. Just rename it by going into the <em>General Settings</em> tab in the <strong>Settings</strong> app.</p>
<h2 id="5-_It_Isn’t_All_There…-Yet">5. It Isn’t All There….Yet</h2><p>I personally bought the Omega because it promised NodeJS support but quickly found out that it’s still not there. There are some posts in the forums where people have gotten NodeJS to run but it’s a very old version and there is no available documentation on how you’d use it to interact with hardware even if you did manage to get it setup. That said, the team is working like crazy with new hardware updates coming pretty much weekly. Filming a getting started tutorial has proved difficult because new things are being added so quickly. </p>
<p>From what I’ve seen so far I have no reason to suspect that the team won’t deliver on its promises and they are very active in the community forums. Just know that it’s not quite everything it’s billed to be on the marketing pages yet but appears to be getting there fast.</p>
<h2 id="Questions">Questions</h2><p>Have any questions about the Omega? I’d love to try to answer them for you and am feverishly trying to put together some µCasts to help you get started with it. Ask below in the comments and I’ll see if I can dig up the answer for you.</p>

<p>Have you ordered  your <a href="https://tessel.io/" target="_blank" rel="external">Tessel 2</a> and can’t wait for it to ship later this year? Have you messed around with the <a href="https://tessel.io/blog/118385488827/contributing-to-tessel-2-without-hardware" target="_blank" rel="external">virtual image</a> and maybe even started on a <a href="https://tessel.io/docs/DIYModule" target="_blank" rel="external">DIY Module</a> for it but are still looking for ways to pass the time before it arrives? Why not make a case for it?</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<h2 id="A_Little_Case_History">A Little Case History</h2><p>About a year ago I came across <a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/8RLUdNb" target="_blank" rel="external">a Raspberry Pi case made from a manila folder</a> on imgur. I immediately made one. I thought it was awesome but a little flimsy. A few days later I was enjoying my morning cereal when the thought occurred to me that the cardboard thickness of a cereal box would be perfect. So <a href="http://imgur.com/gallery/pTDkD" target="_blank" rel="external">I made a few</a> and even modified the original plans to <a href="http://www.microcasts.tv/blog/2014/09/24/cereal-box-pi-cases/">support other models of the Pi</a>. Fast forward a year and Technical Machine sends me a Tessel 2 to play with but it doesn’t have a case. So I made one.</p>
<p><strong>DISCLAIMER</strong>: <em>I have not run the Raspberry Pi or Tessel for extended periods inside of these cases so I have no idea if they will overheat. To be safe you may want to carve some sweet ventilation holes to help with air circulation.</em></p>
<h2 id="Assembly_Instructions">Assembly Instructions</h2><p>The Tessel 2 case wasn’t really that hard to throw together. I basically took the Raspberry Pi case design and modified the dimensions and cutouts. A digital caliper and a few hours of trial and error was all it took to get everything just right. So if you’re interested in getting a case all ready for that special day when your Tessel 2 arrives here are the instructions.</p>
<h3 id="1-_Download_It,_Print_It,_Cut_It">1. Download It, Print It, Cut It</h3><ul>
<li><a href="/blog/2015/08/05/Tessel-2-Cereal-Box-Case/Tessel2_Case.dwg">DWG Design File</a></li>
<li><a href="/blog/2015/08/05/Tessel-2-Cereal-Box-Case/Tessel2_Case.pdf">PDF Version</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You have a couple of options here. The <code>.dwg</code> file should open in pretty much any CAD application (I used <a href="http://www.3ds.com/products-services/draftsight-cad-software/free-download/" target="_blank" rel="external">DraftSight</a>) and is great if you want to modify the design a bit or adapt it to another project. For everyone else I’d recommend just downloading the PDF version. The case is to scale but you have to print it that way so <strong>make sure any autoscaling is turned off</strong> or else the dimensions won’t be quite right. The bottom portion of the case printout should be exactly 60mm wide if you want to check it with a ruler.</p>
<p>Once you’ve printed out the plan it’s time to cut it out. Take your time on this part. The folding dimensions are pretty exact and since you’ll be transferring it in the next step you want this master template to be as accurate as possible.</p>
<p><img class="img-responsive" src="/blog/2015/08/05/Tessel-2-Cereal-Box-Case/case_template.jpg" alt="Case Template"></p>
<h3 id="2-_Transfer_It_and_Cut_It">2. Transfer It and Cut It</h3><p>Once you have your template you can transfer the design to any medium that’s not too thick. My mediums of choice are empty cereal boxes and other food boxes because they have designs built-in and the cardboard is just right but you can use anything you want. </p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Make sure you have the template facing the right way. Too many times I’ve had it flipped over and once it’s folded the cool design you are trying to transfer is on the inside of the case instead of the outside. Right side up is with the port slits on the right. So you want to trace it with the template on the box like this:</p>
<p><img class="img-responsive" src="/blog/2015/08/05/Tessel-2-Cereal-Box-Case/case_template_orientation.jpg" alt="Correct cutout orientation of case template"></p>
<p>Again, it’s important to take your time on this step and get the template trace as accurate as possible so the case fits your Tessel properly. Once it’s traced it’s time to cut it out again. At this point just cut out the outline of the case. <strong>DO NOT cut out the internal pieces (power, USB, ethernet, ports) just yet.</strong> I recommend scissors for the outline cut and then a utility knife for the internal cutouts when you get that far.</p>
<p><img class="img-responsive" src="/blog/2015/08/05/Tessel-2-Cereal-Box-Case/fp_case_cutout.jpg" alt="Case outline cut out"></p>
<h3 id="3-_Fold_It">3. Fold It</h3><p>Before we cut out the holes we want to fold the case first. The reason for this is because the power and port slits are so close to a fold line that once the holes are there the folds can be difficult to get right as the case is flimsy at those points.</p>
<p>The fold lines are on your template but they need to be transferred to the back of your cutout. The blank side. This is what mine looks like.</p>
<p><img class="img-responsive" src="/blog/2015/08/05/Tessel-2-Cereal-Box-Case/fp_case_fold_marks.jpg" alt="Fold marks"></p>
<p>The best way I’ve found to do this is by using a ruler or even a piece of printed circuit board. Place the ruler or PCB along a fold line to help you get a straight fold edge.</p>
<h3 id="4-_Cut_It_Again_and_Vent_It">4. Cut It Again and Vent It</h3><p>To finish things up use a utility knife to cut out the port, power, USB, and ethernet holes. You can now add some ventilation slits/holes if you wish. <em>If you plan on running your Tessel for extended periods I highly recommend venting it in some way.</em></p>
<p><img class="img-responsive" src="/blog/2015/08/05/Tessel-2-Cereal-Box-Case/fp_case_fully_cutout.jpg" alt="Case fully cut out and ready for installation"></p>
<h3 id="5-_Wait">5. Wait</h3><p>I know September isn’t coming fast enough but put your case in a safe place and wait for the arrival of your Tessel.</p>
<h3 id="6-_Install_the_Tessel">6. Install the Tessel</h3><p>Once your Tessel does arrive getting the case on is very easy. Slide the two ports into their slits while making sure the Tessel is oriented correctly so the power, USB, and ethernet will line up with their respective knockouts. Once the ports are snug in the case you can just fold the bottom of the case over while lining up the front knockouts. All of the outter tabs are meant to fold under the Tessel and be held in place by the bottom of the case. A single piece of tape at the back is normally plenty to hold the entire thing together. </p>
<p><img class="img-responsive" src="/blog/2015/08/05/Tessel-2-Cereal-Box-Case/fp_case_bottom.jpg" alt="Finished case on the Tessel"></p>
<h2 id="Share_Your_Case">Share Your Case</h2><p>That’s all there is to it. It’s a very inexpensive way to have a sweet looking case on your Tessel. If you make a case for your Tessel 2 I’d love to hear about it. If you find a cool medium to use share it in the comments below and if you send me a picture of your case I’ll happily post it here. </p>

<p>Chances are you’ve heard of the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/elanlee/exploding-kittens" target="_blank" rel="external">most-backed game in Kickstarter history</a>. If not, stop here, and go check out <a href="http://explodingkittens.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Exploding Kittens</a> for a minute and then come back. After months of anticipation my copy of the game showed up last week.</p>
<p><strong>Spoiler Alert:  I’m about to reveal what the surprise is inside the Exploding Kittens box. If you don’t want that ruined stop here and come back after you’ve personally experienced it.</strong></p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p><iframe src="https://vine.co/v/eHDjiYnwxKl/embed/simple" width="480" height="480" frameborder="0"></iframe><script src="https://platform.vine.co/static/scripts/embed.js"></script></p>
<p>After repeating this process no less than 15 times for the kids I figured that some people might be interested in knowing exactly how the surprise works. It’s actually a pretty genius piece of electronics. Hence this “teardown” post to uncover the magic.</p>
<p>Playing a noise or sound when you open something isn’t exactly mind-blowing technology. In fact, you’ve probably received one of those fancy birthday cards that sing to you when you open it. But how does the box know you’ve opened it? It’s actually quite simple. Let’s take a look.</p>
<p><img class="img-responsive" src="/blog/2015/08/02/Exploding-Kittens-Teardown/exploding_kittens_lid.jpg" alt="Exploding Kittens Inside Lid"></p>
<p>This is what the inside lid of the game looks like. The illustrations inside and out are amazing but if you look closely at the taco cat on the right you’ll notice he has a wonky eye. Upon closer inspection you’ll see that his left eye is a photoresistor.</p>
<p><img class="img-responsive" src="/blog/2015/08/02/Exploding-Kittens-Teardown/exploding_kittens_eye.jpg" alt="Photoresistor Eye"></p>
<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoresistor" target="_blank" rel="external">photoresistor</a> is just a variable resistor kind of like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potentiometer" target="_blank" rel="external">potentiometer</a> but instead of turning a knob or screw, the resistance varies by how much light it is exposed to. Pretty cool. When it’s really dark the photoresistor will have a very high resistance while in the light it will have a low resistance. </p>
<p><iframe src="https://vine.co/v/eHDdbeBwxgq/embed/simple" width="480" height="480" frameborder="0"></iframe><script src="https://platform.vine.co/static/scripts/embed.js"></script></p>
<p>So how do we use that to tell if the box is open? Well, let’s take a look at the rest of the goods. As it turns out we can open the compartment on the right side of the lid and pull out a plastic tray that contains all of the hardware.</p>
<h1 style="text-align:center;"><img class="img-responsive" src="/blog/2015/08/02/Exploding-Kittens-Teardown/exploding_kittens_pcb.png" alt="Exploding Kittens PCB"></h1>

<p>There really isn’t a lot going on. So the main components here are power (3 coin batteries), a microcontroller (concealed by the black epoxy blob), a photoresistor (light sensor) and the speaker. The idea is that the box will be almost perfectly dark when closed causing a high resistance across the photoresistor. When you open the box the light floods in and causes the resistance to drop. The microcontroller detects that change and proceeds to play the cat sound. But how does a microcontroller detect a change in resistance? Well it doesn’t exactly. It uses one of the most basic circuits in electronics, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage_divider" target="_blank" rel="external">voltage divider</a>.</p>
<p><img class="img-responsive" src="/blog/2015/08/02/Exploding-Kittens-Teardown/voltage_divider.png" alt="Voltage Divider"></p>
<p>The basic concept here is that when two resistors are connected together like this they produce an output voltage Vout that is a fraction of the input voltage Vin. That output value can be precisely controlled by the values you pick for resistors Z1 and Z2. Check out the Wikipedia link for more info on how that calculation works. In our Exploding Kittens circuit, one of the resistors is fixed. It’s the tiny surface mount one labeled R1. The other resistor is our photoresistor which changes based on the amount of light it is exposed to. If we look at our voltage divider circuit above you can see that Vout is a point between Z1 and Z2. If you look closely at the circuit board you can see that a trace on the printed circuit board goes from the right pin of the photoresistor up to the epoxy blob where it connects to the microcontroller underneath. So what it’s actually sending to the microcontroller is a voltage that varies based on how light or dark it is. From there the microcontroller uses what’s called an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog-to-digital_converter" target="_blank" rel="external">Analog to Digital Converter</a> or ADC to sample that voltage and turn it into a digital value. That digital value can then be used to tell if the box is open or closed. Pretty neat.</p>
<h3 id="But_Wait,_There’s_More">But Wait, There’s More</h3><p>If you look closely at the board you will notice two silver pads at 7 and 8 o’clock on the epoxy blob. They are labeled <em>SDA</em> and <em>SCL</em>. Those are the common names of communication lines in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2C" target="_blank" rel="external">I2C</a> communication protocol. SDA is the data line and SCL is the clock line for timing communication on the data line. What are those for? My guess is that they are there for debug/testing purposes. If I had more time I’d hook some wires up to it and use the i2c-tools on the Raspberry Pi to see what address it has and possibly query it for data. It may even be possible to modify the data that produces the meow sound or it might just be a way to verify that the photoresistor is working correctly in a test harness.</p>
<h3 id="Wrap_Up">Wrap Up</h3><p>I think the box opening surprise was a slick addition to an already very polished deliverable. And even though this is just a very simple circuit design there were quite a few topics involved including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Photoresistors</li>
<li>Resistance</li>
<li>Voltage Dividers</li>
<li>Microcontrollers</li>
<li>I2C Communication Protocol</li>
<li>Analog to Digital Converters</li>
</ul>
<p>So the next time you bust out Exploding Kittens and open the box you’ll know exactly what’s going on.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This Episode was made specially for <a href="https://twitter.com/TimPietrusky" target="_blank" rel="external">Tim Pietrusky</a>. I asked the Twitterverse if anybody had a question that I could answer in video form and Tim sent this:</p>
<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-partner="tweetdeck"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/KevinSidwar" target="_blank" rel="external">@KevinSidwar</a> How can I control an USB <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/bluetooth?src=hash" target="_blank" rel="external">#bluetooth</a> adapter via <a href="https://twitter.com/nodejs" target="_blank" rel="external">@nodejs</a> on a <a href="https://twitter.com/Raspberry_Pi" target="_blank" rel="external">@Raspberry_Pi</a> to send data from my smartphone to the Pi?</p>&mdash; Tim Pietrusky (@TimPietrusky) <a href="https://twitter.com/TimPietrusky/status/563131851368566784" target="_blank" rel="external">February 5, 2015</a></blockquote></p>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>So Tim, hopefully this answers your question and can also be useful to others looking to do something similar in their project.</p>
<p><strong>Note for Android Users:</strong> I don’t have an Android device so I linked up an app that looks like it should do things similar to LightBlue. Basically you need a test app that can explore and interact with the characteristics of a BLE device service.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So you’ve flashed your Edison and now, when you plug it in, it doesn’t show up as a drive anymore in Windows explorer. At first you might think you broke something but it’s not you, it’s Windows. It actually knows the drive is there and in this video I show you how to get it to show up again in Explorer. For those that like the written word over video, here are the steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>Launch the Disk Management tool in Windows.</li>
<li>Find the Edison Disk which should show up as an Unallocated disk between 500 and 800 MB.</li>
<li>Right click on the disk and select <strong>Create New Simple Volume</strong>. This will open the New Simple Volume Wizard</li>
<li>Click Next.</li>
<li>Click Next</li>
<li>Change the drive letter assignment if you want and click Next.</li>
<li>Change the format file system from NTFS to <strong>FAT32</strong>.</li>
<li>Give your Edison volume a name.</li>
<li>Click Next.</li>
<li><p>Click Next on the last screen and Windows will start creating the new volume. </p>
<p>The volume creation can take a few minutes so just be patient. After that the drive will show up again in Windows Explorer.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In this &micro;Cast I’m going to show you how to replace the default Yocto linux image on your Intel Edison with Ubilinux from Emutex Labs. The Yocto linux distro that comes pre-installed on the Intel Edison is a great option for embedded applications because you can customize the distro to fit your end product and off you go. It’s not great, however, for playing around with different things and exploring what your Edison is capable of and can seem a little unfamiliar if you’re used to all the amenities of other embedded linux distros like Raspbian. Building packages from source and installing them is a pain, especially if you’re used to having a package manager. That’s where Ubilinux comes in. It’s based on the Debian “wheezy” distro which, for any Raspberry Pi fans, is the same thing that Raspbian is based on. It comes with C and C++ dev tools, perl, python, node.js and most importantly a package manager so trying new things on the Edison is as easy as apt-get install.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Summary">Summary</h2><p>The Clear Core Light Pipe from Sparkfun is basically a length of solid core plastic tubing that transmits light while “bleeding” light along the length. It can be used to “pop out” a status led from inside an enclosure to the exterior by shining the LED in one end and having light emitted from the other end. It’s kind of like fiber optics but has the additional property that light leaks out all along the length kind of like a glow bracelet or necklace but not as bright. While pretty neat stuff for dark applications the glow effect is lacking when lights are on and is basically undetectable in sunlight conditions.</p>
<h2 id="Price">Price</h2><p>Priced about $5/ft seems a bit high for what is essentially a solid rubber-like cord.</p>
<h2 id="Quality">Quality</h2><p>Not too much can go wrong with this stuff. It’s unlikely to break unless you’re really rough with it.</p>
<h2 id="As_Advertised">As Advertised</h2><p>Pretty much as advertised by Sparkfun although I do feel that it’s not clear just how much the light dims out along the length. I was expecting the color to hold up more over the length of the pipe.</p>
<h2 id="Ease_of_Use">Ease of Use</h2><p>Pretty easy to cut but can be a little tricky to get an LED “mounted” to it. Sparkfun recommends using a piece of shrink tube which works well but if you don’t have any you’ll have a hard time mating it to an LED.</p>

<h1 style="text-align:center;"><img src="/img/port/iot_stocking_stuffers.jpg"></h1>

<p>The holiday season is fast approaching and you’re facing the daunting task of shopping for that Internet of Things Someone in your life. Well don’t fret because we are actually really easy to shop for. If it blinks, plugs into a computer, or just screams nerd we’ll probably love it. But just in case you need a few extra ideas here are some stocking stuffers that are always appreciated.</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<h2 id="1-_An_#IoT_Platform">1. An #IoT Platform</h2><img src="/img/port/pi_a_plus.jpg" class="right" width="300" height="300" title="Raspberry Pi A+">
<p>While a little pricey for a stocking stuffer these things are getting so small that they might got lost in all the wrapping paper if you put them under the tree. Here are a few that your nerdy loved one wouldn’t complain about getting.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.element14.com/community/community/raspberry-pi/raspberry-pi-aplus" target="_blank" rel="external">Raspberry Pi Model A+</a> - $20</li>

<li><a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13025" target="_blank" rel="external">Intel Edison</a> - $75</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2-_Battery_Pack">2. Battery Pack</h2><img src="/img/port/usb_battery.jpg" class="right" width="200" height="200" title="USB Battery Pack">
<p>When powering our IoT projects sometimes it’s annoying to plug it into a computer or find a wall adapter. Since many of the platforms can be powered from a USB port a battery pack that has one built in is a perfect gift. Here are a few suggestions. The higher the mAh the longer the battery will last between charges.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/1959" target="_blank" rel="external">2200 mAh USB Batter Pack</a> - $15</li>

    <id>http://www.microcasts.tv/episodes/2014/10/16/edison-mini-breakout-the-real-getting-started-guide/</id>
    <published>2014-10-16T20:45:00.000Z</published>
    <updated>2015-07-10T03:41:05.000Z</updated>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 style="text-align:center;"><img class="img-responsive" src="wide_edison_breakout.jpg"></h1>

<p>So I sat down the other night to finally start playing with my <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/do-it-yourself/edison.html" target="_blank" rel="external">Intel Edison</a> board and quickly found out that the documentation for this thing really sucks. There are forums and pages and PDFs spread all over the Intel site and most of the content centers around using the Arduino breakout board. For those of us using the <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13025" target="_blank" rel="external">mini breakout board</a> we are left to our own resourcefulness to get this thing up and running. There is even incorrect info in the <a href="https://communities.intel.com/docs/DOC-23147" target="_blank" rel="external">Quickstart</a> that might leave beginners scratching their heads. If Intel wants this thing to get widespread community adoption it needs to spend significantly more time making the first experience a better one. </p>
<p>Until then, here is my version of how to get started with the Edison mini breakout board. This is the guide I wish I had for my first experience.</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<h2 id="Unboxing_and_Setup">Unboxing and Setup</h2><p>So Intel nailed the unboxing part. The Edison comes in a sweet box and opening it evokes a few oooohs and aaahs. That’s about where it ends though. They have a getting started url right under the box lid which makes you think that they are really going to help you through the process but unfortunately you’re mostly on your own at this point. The link has only partially relevant instructions to the mini breakout and even some of the relevant stuff has errors.</p>
<p><strong>STOP:</strong> Installing a header is completely optional but if you intend to connect your Edison to external hardware at some point I recommend you solder one on now. You can always do it later but the tiny 70 pin Hirose connector makes me nervous so I’d rather not stress it with unnecessary insertions and removals.</p>
<h3 id="Install_a_Header_(Optional)">Install a Header (Optional)</h3><p>If you intend to connect any external hardware to your Edison you’re going to need access to the GPIO pins. These are located under the Edison itself on the breakout board. </p>
<p>You can individually solder wires to this but I personally recommend breaking all of the pins out to a header for easy connection. This is really easy to do even for a beginner so don’t be afraid. The pins are standard 0.1” spaced so any <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/116" target="_blank" rel="external">generic male header strip</a> will do. Break the header strip into 14 pin segments and install them side by side on a breadboard as seen below. Make sure the long end of the header strip pins is in the breadboard so the short side is pointing up.</p>
<h1 style="text-align:center;"><img class="img-responsive" src="header_guide.jpg"></h1>

<p>This will be your jig for soldering. Place the breakout board onto the pins so that the USB connectors are on top. Solding the headers in upside down will definitely ruin your day. The breakout should sit on the pins and feel nice and level. If installed correctly the header pins will just barely protrude from the holes. This ensures that they won’t interfere with seating the Edison later on. If the pins stick out too far then you’ve got your header installed upside down on the breadboard.</p>
<h1 style="text-align:center;"><img class="img-responsive" src="header_pre_solder.jpg"></h1>

<p>For soldering I highly recommend using a <a href="http://www.alliedelec.com/search/productdetail.aspx?SKU=70177953" target="_blank" rel="external">flux pen</a>. It will help the solder flow into the joints. Take your time soldering and make sure you get a good solder flow on each joint and be careful not to over-apply solder as it will ball up on the pin and not create a good joint. Here is what mine looked like when I was done. You can see that there are a few joints that aren’t as nice as the others but we should be okay. I used some rubbing alcohol and a clean t-shirt rag to clean the flux up after soldering.</p>
<h1 style="text-align:center;"><img class="img-responsive" src="header_post_solder.jpg"></h1>

<h3 id="Insert_the_Edison">Insert the Edison</h3><p>Because of the mounting holes it’s pretty much impossible to install the Edison the wrong way on the breakout board. Just be careful seating it as the 70 pin connector has very tiny contacts that can be damaged if you’re not careful. Get the Edison nice and level over the connector and push straight down on it right about where the sticker is below the metal housing. You should hear a good sounding click.</p>
<h1 style="text-align:center;"><img class="img-responsive" src="push_here.jpg"></h1>

<p>Install the two nuts provided to hold the Edison in place.</p>
<h2 id="Install_Software_and_Drivers">Install Software and Drivers</h2><p>The Quickstart guide provided by Intel has you install the Arduino IDE next. Now even though this isn’t the Arduino breakout you can still write sketches and run them. You just have to break out the appropriate pins yourself. I’m not interested in Arduino functionality so I opted to skip that part but if you want you can <a href="https://communities.intel.com/docs/DOC-23242" target="_blank" rel="external">install that now</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://communities.intel.com/docs/DOC-23147#jive_content_id_Step_3__Install_required_drivers" target="_blank" rel="external">driver installation step</a> from the Quickstart is one of the few items they nailed in the guide and you can follow the instructions <a href="https://communities.intel.com/docs/DOC-23147#jive_content_id_Step_3__Install_required_drivers" target="_blank" rel="external">there</a>. Basically you’re downloading and installing two sets of drivers: one for the FTDI interface and one for the Edison itself. Here are the links for both. Just click through the installations.</p>
<h3 id="FTDI_Drivers">FTDI Drivers</h3><ul>
<li><a href="http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/CDM/CDM%20v2.10.00%20WHQL%20Certified.exe" target="_blank" rel="external">FTDI Driver Setup</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Edison_Drivers">Edison Drivers</h3><ul>
<li><a href="http://downloadmirror.intel.com/24271/eng/IntelEdisonDriverSetup1.0.0.exe" target="_blank" rel="external">Edison Windows Driver Setup</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Terminal_Emulator">Terminal Emulator</h3><ul>
<li><a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html" target="_blank" rel="external">PuTTY</a></li>
</ul>
<p>For your computer to talk to the Edison at first you will need to use a serial connection. This is acheived over USB with the FTDI drivers which essentially speak USB to the FTDI chip on your breakout board and then the FTDI chip translates USB to serial for the Edison to understand. A terminal emulator is the program that runs on your PC that manages that connection. The most popular one is <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html" target="_blank" rel="external">PuTTY</a> but you can use any terminal emulator you feel comfortable with.</p>
<h2 id="Powering_Your_Edison">Powering Your Edison</h2><p>This one stumped me a little at first. There are two USB ports on the mini breakout and I assumed one was for power and communication and the other was for connecting devices to the Edison so it could act as a USB host. You probably didn’t assume that but if you did you would be wrong…just like me. One of the USB ports is for communicating with your PC via the terminal emulator and the other is one of the ways you can power the Edison. As found in <a href="https://communities.intel.com/thread/55455" target="_blank" rel="external">this thread</a> there are actually 3 different ways to power your Edison via the breakout board.</p>
<ul>
<li>5V via the USB connector</li>
<li>7-12V via J21</li>
<li>Single Cell LiPo battery via J2</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="text-align:center;"><img class="img-responsive" src="power_options.jpg"></h1>

<h2 id="Configuring_Your_Edison">Configuring Your Edison</h2><p>Once you’ve decided on a power strategy for your Edison it’s time to power it up and play with it. By default your Edison comes with <a href="https://www.yoctoproject.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">Yocto Linux</a> installed but you’ll need to configure it. </p>
<ol>
<li>Connect the Edison to your PC with the USB cable.</li>
<li>Apply power. The easiest way to do this is via the second USB port. I didn’t have a free port on my PC so I used a USB battery pack and it worked great.</li>
<li>Launch Device Manager (Go to Start and search “Device Manager” if you can’t find it)</li>
<li>In Device Manager expand the <strong>Ports</strong> section and find the entry named <em>USB Serial Port (COM…)</em>. In parenthesis is the COM port your Edison can talk on. On my machine it’s COM4.<br> <img class="img-responsive" src="com_port.jpg"></li>
<li>Launch your terminal emulator. These instructions assume you’re using PuTTY.</li>
<li><p>Set the following options for communication</p>
<ul>
<li>Connection Type: <strong>Serial</strong></li>
<li>Serial Line: <strong>[The COM value you found in step 4]</strong></li>
<li>Speed: <strong>115200</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><img class="img-responsive" src="putty_config.jpg"></p>
</li>
<li><p>Click <strong>Open</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>NOTE: You are now about to start experiencing a super annoying defect in the Edison UART. This is what the datasheet says:</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><em>When Edison goes into low power sleep, the UART internal FIFO and interface is powered down. Therefore, a two-wire UART (Rx/Tx) will lose the first received character whenever Edison is in sleep mode.</em></p>
<p><strong>Basically if you don’t type anything for about 20 seconds or so the next time you press a key in the terminal it will wake up the Edison but not register your key. You’ll have to hit it again. It’s very annoying and I will post info on how to disable sleep mode as soon as I figure it out</strong></p>
</li>
<li>Wait for the blank terminal window to appear.</li>
<li>Hit <strong>Enter</strong> twice. You may have to hit it 3 times if you waited too long. Told you it was annoying.<ol>
<li>At the login prompt type <strong>root</strong></li>
<li>At the next prompt type <strong>configure_edison</strong></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Follow the prompts through the configuration. If the Edison doesn’t locate any WiFi networks at first just press <strong>0</strong> to have it rescan. Mine didn’t find any the first time around for some reason.</p>
<h2 id="Start_Poking_Around">Start Poking Around</h2><p>Once you’ve finished configuring your Edison you can essentially treat it like a Linux machine. I was surprised to find that it had NodeJS and NPM installed and was able to get an Express website up and running within a couple of minutes. </p>
<p>A few things of note:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you want to create/edit files the Edison comes with Vim which can be launched with <strong>vi</strong></li>
<li>To shut down the Edison use <strong>systemctl poweroff</strong></li>
<li>If you’re coming from Raspberry Pi land most of the Linux commands you already know still apply</li>
</ul>

<p>So I sat down the other night to finally start playing with my <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/do-it-yourself/edison.html">Intel Edison</a> board and quickly found out that the documentation for this thing really sucks. There are forums and pages and PDFs spread all over the Intel site and most of the content centers around using the Arduino breakout board. For those of us using the <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13025">mini breakout board</a> we are left to our own resourcefulness to get this thing up and running. There is even incorrect info in the <a href="https://communities.intel.com/docs/DOC-23147">Quickstart</a> that might leave beginners scratching their heads. If Intel wants this thing to get widespread community adoption it needs to spend significantly more time making the first experience a better one. </p>
<p>Until then, here is my version of how to get started with the Edison mini breakout board. This is the guide I wish I had for my first experience.</p>]]>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 style="text-align:center;"><img src="/img/port/cereal_cases.jpg" width="640" height="360"></h1>

<p>So last week I found a pic on Imgur posted by quantumCity showing a <a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/8RLUdNb" target="_blank" rel="external">Raspberry Pi case made from a manila folder</a>. Needless to say I found it to be a pretty neat way to throw together a case from something lying around the house that didn’t consist of using Legos. He posted the CAD file and a pdf version so all you have to do is print it, transfer it, cut it, and fold it. It worked like a charm on the first try.</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p>The only problem was that I found it to be a little flimsy for my taste, not to mention kinda plain. So I had the idea to try using a cereal box which is made of a sturdier, yet still thin enough, material. I raided the pantry and pretty soon had Captain Crunch staring on the case of my Model B+ Pi. After that I was obsessed and spent the time to create printouts for the Model A and B and want to share them with the community.</p>
<h3 id="Sorry,_No_CAD_Files">Sorry, No CAD Files</h3><p>I found the original .dwg file to be a huge pain as I wasn’t able to easily modify it and my PC didn’t want to install any of the open source programs capable of working with it. So I created my models in <a href="http://www.sketchup.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">SketchUp</a> and have included those files as well as a to-scale PDF that you can just print and use for each.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/img/port/ModelA_case.skp">Model A Sketchup File</a></li>
<li><a href="/img/port/ModelA_case.pdf">Model A PDF</a></li>
<li><a href="/img/port/ModelB_case.skp">Model B Sketchup File</a></li>
<li><a href="/img/port/ModelB_case.pdf">Model B PDF</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> If you try to print the PDF you need to make sure there is no scaling in the print settings like Fit to Page. Otherwise the dimensions won’t be quite right.</p>
<h3 id="Get_Creative">Get Creative</h3><p>There are so many things that could work as a medium here and I’d love to see what people come up with. Feel free to modify the design too. You could cut out the back corner to allow access to the GPIO header or even cut some sweet vent designs if you’re worried about overheating. If you make a case using one of the plans I would love it if you linked to a picture in the comments.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Internet of Things is all the rage lately. It seems to be all that tech sites want to talk about and therefore what a ton of startups want to work on. I’ve been watching this space closely for the last 5 years and I can’t help but compare hardware, in it’s current iteration, to being just like kitchen gadgets on the Home Shopping Network (link intentionally left off). What do I mean by that? Well, let’s talk about apples for a minute.<br><a id="more"></a></p>
<img src="/img/port/fuji_money.jpg" class="right">
<h2 id="Apple_Tech">Apple Tech</h2><p>Not the kind that comes with 64GB of flash or a digital crown. I’m talking plain old apples here. The kind you grow in orchards. Did you know that you can easily spend over $50 on apple tech to help prepare a Fuji for consumption. $33 for the peeler, $10 for the corer and then another $10 for the slicer to create perfectly prepared apple portions. I’m sure all of these things do their job extremely well. But after I clamp the peeler to my counter and include the time and energy it takes me to wash all of those things every time I want an apple am I really better off?  No. And that’s why I still use my potato peeler and a sharp knife to prepare apples…just like my grandmother almost a century ago. And it’s not just apples. There are slicers, mixers, special spoons and baking dishes. Thousands of things and if I bought every piece of kitchen tech out there I’d need a semi truck to hold it all. And not a single one fundamentally changes how I eat apples.</p>
<h2 id="Hardware_“Kitchen”_Appliances">Hardware “Kitchen” Appliances</h2><p>By and large this is where hardware is stuck at the moment. We’re in a massive movement of <strong>“Build it Because We Can”</strong>. The number of platforms that have come out in just the past 5 to 7 years has launched hardware to center stage. Normal people can do things with hardware in their basement that were either too hard or just too expensive 10 years ago. Do you have any idea how hard it was to create a <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/fresh-coffee-at-mailchimp/" target="_blank" rel="external">WiFi enabled coffee pot</a> 10 years ago? Even 5 years ago? Now you can take your pick of platforms to help you do it in an evening for less than $100. <a href="http://raspberrypi.org" target="_blank" rel="external">Raspberry Pi</a>, <a href="https://tessel.io/" target="_blank" rel="external">Tessel</a>, <a href="https://www.spark.io/" target="_blank" rel="external">SparkCore</a>, <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/do-it-yourself/edison.html" target="_blank" rel="external">Edison</a>, <a href="http://arduino.cc/" target="_blank" rel="external">Arduino</a> and <a href="http://postscapes.com/internet-of-things-hardware" target="_blank" rel="external">dozens of other platforms</a> have made hardware development almost trivial in some cases. And with the good comes the questionable. Kickstarter after failed Kickstarter. IoT products that, while novel, don’t fundamentally change our lives as their creators seem to think. Most are just another fancy apple peeler. I hate to pick on anyone but just a few examples.</p>
<h3 id="Cooler">Cooler</h3><img src="/img/port/cooler_cooler.jpg" width="600" height="338">
<p><br><br>Most backed project on Kickstarter ever with over $13 million in pledges. It’s a cooler with a blender, iphone doc and speakers. Oh, and obviously an LED and bottle opener.</p>
<h3 id="Bt-tn">Bt.tn</h3><img src="/img/port/bttn_official_web.png" width="600" height="425">
<p><br><br>A $99 button that connects to the internet which can be programmed to perform a task when you press it.</p>
<h3 id="Blink(1)">Blink(1)</h3><img src="/img/port/blink_1.jpg" width="600" height="363">
<p><br><br>A $35 programmable indicator light.</p>
<p>All of these are novel, maybe even cool, nice to have projects but are they really representative of “What’s Next” for hardware and the already-started Internet of Things revolution? My historical vote is, no. At least I sure hope not.</p>
<h2 id="Hardware_is_the_New_Software">Hardware is the New Software</h2><p>I’ve heard that phrase floating around the interwebs. “Hardware is the new software.” It’s easy to say and I happen to agree actually but what does it mean? I think software has shown us the trajectory that hardware is going to follow. Software has been around since the 50s but if we look at mass adoption/creation in the “hacker” community it’s really been around since the Mac and Windows came out. I’m going to say the mid to late 80s. It was a great time of normal people doing amazing things that software had never done before because it was, you guessed it, either too hard or just too expensive a decade earlier. But just a short decade later the whole thing came crashing down. Only those pieces of software that fundamentally changed our lives made it through the event horizon known as the dot com bubble. The novelty wore off and we were left to realize that as humans we have an innate ability to filter noise out of our technical lives. And so it will go with hardware. The noise will all get filtered out. I think we’re about 5 to 7 years in and the crash is coming. It’s only after the implosion that the truly interesting and paradigm-shifting things will emerge and really take shape.</p>
<h2 id="So_What_Do_We_Do?">So What Do We Do?</h2><p>Just let if flow. I don’t know that there is a way to avoid the great hardware filter that’s coming because I genuinely think that it’s a necessary part of the evolutionary cycle of hardware. The Kitchen Appliance Phase of hardware, while annoying at times, isn’t inherently bad. It’s just a part of the journey that hardware has to go through. We have to get through this stage. Get it out of our system so we can move on to the really interesting things. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble" target="_blank" rel="external">Dot-com Bubble</a> wasn’t a complete waste. It didn’t kill software. On the contrary, it forced it to the next level and that’s exactly what hardware is waiting on. </p>
<p>I, for one, have never been more pumped. These are really exciting times and the future potential is seemingly unlimited. We’re learning things that we need to learn and pushing the movement forward. Just make sure you understand what’s coming and hopefully that will help you effectively navigate through it.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the last week I’ve seen several articles pop up comparing the new Intel Edison to the Raspberry Pi to the Arduino to the [enter some other development platform here]. The problem with every single one of these is that they are missing the boat when it comes to choosing a development platform for your next project.</p>
<h2 id="Specs_Don’t_Matter…(Mostly)">Specs Don’t Matter…(Mostly)</h2><p>The easy thing to do when you want to create a new piece of tech content is just compare the specs of the different platforms. This table was part of a recent ReadWrite article.</p>
<p></p><h1 style="text-align:center"><a href="/img/port/compare_table.png"><img src="/img/port/compare_table.png" alt="Comparison Table"></a></h1><br><br><p></p>
<p>At a glance you can compare the CPU speed, memory and GPIO count. What it doesn’t show, or even help with, is how to pick one for your next DIY project.</p>
<h2 id="What_Really_Matters">What Really Matters</h2><p>So what really matters when picking a platform for your next project? Normally it has nothing to do with performance specs because almost any platform will be have plenty of performance to read your sensor and display the results or push it to the web. For me the most important questions aren’t how much flash memory a platform has or what the input voltage is. It’s a balancing act between a few key metrics.</p>
<h3 id="Battery_or_Plugged_In?">Battery or Plugged In?</h3><p>What do I mean by that? Well, first and foremost you need to ask yourself “Is my project going to be battery powered or can it always be plugged in?” Right away this is going to limit my choices. While I love the Raspberry Pi and know that it can be battery powered I’m probably not going to choose it because it it such a power hog when compared to something like an Arduino Uno or Sparkcore. </p>
<h3 id="Compute_Intensive?_How_Intense?">Compute Intensive? How Intense?</h3><p>After thining about the power constraints, the next thing I ask is what kind of compute power do I need. What I think most newcomers miss is that a massive share of beginner projects don’t need an ARM processor running at 700MHz. But when you compare that to the 16MHz of the Arduino Uno you may think “Well, that’s not going to be powerful enough.” Remember the Apollo missions that flew rockets into outerspace (whether you believe we landed on the moon or not…we did…it’s certain that we did launch things into orbit)? The guidance computers on those spacecraft had approximately 64K, that’s K not M or G, of memory and ran at an astonishingly fast, at the time, 2.048MHz. You can accomplish a LOT with very little in embedded systems.</p>
<h3 id="Intangibles">Intangibles</h3><p>The 3rd item I focus on is how much time I want to spend on the project. A lot of this relates to what language I can program in and what the community looks like for a certain platform. Is there a lot of shared code out there I can use or do I have to write it myself? The new Intel Edison may seem like a good fit for your project because of it’s size and specs but the community is very young still so you probably can’t count on a lot of examples to help you along if you get stuck. Maybe a spark core would be a better fit. This final category has a lot of sub categories. What if I just really want to develop in Javascript. Well then I have to look at something like a Tessel or Raspberry Pi.</p>
<p>Sometimes you may have conflicting requirements like a device that needs to be battery powered but outputs 1080p video to a built in monitor. Just remember that there are other factors that, in my opinion, are more important than base specs. After all, if your project only needs 3 I/O pins it doesn’t really matter if your platform has 10, 30, or 50.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Did you even know the Raspberry Pi had a serial port? If you did and have tried to use it in Raspbian you’ve probably run in to some weird behavior. That’s because, by default, the serial port is tied up by the operating system so it can’t be reliably used in your projects. In this episode I show you how to configure the serial port so it can be used to make your awesome ideas reality.</p>
<h2 id="TL;DR">TL;DR</h2><p>All you have to do is modify two files to reclaim the serial port from Raspbian. The rest of this post shows you how.</p>
<h3 id="/etc/inittab">/etc/inittab</h3><p>Comment out the line near the very bottom that spawns a getty using the serial port.</p>
<figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="comment">#Spawn a getty on Raspberry Pi serial line</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">#T0:23:respawn:/sbin/getty -L ttyAMA0 115200 vt100  &lt;---- comment this line</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<h3 id="/boot/cmdline-txt">/boot/cmdline.txt</h3><p>Be careful with this one as it contains the parameters sent to the kernel at startup. You need to remove any references to ttyAMA0,115200.</p>
<p>So you would change this:</p>
<figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">dwc_otg.lpm_<span class="built_in">enable</span>=<span class="number">0</span> console=ttyAMA0,<span class="number">115200</span> kgdboc=ttyAMA0,<span class="number">115200</span> console=tty1 root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rootfstype=ext4 rootwait</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>To this:</p>
<figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">dwc_otg.lpm_<span class="built_in">enable</span>=<span class="number">0</span> console=tty1 root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rootfstype=ext4 rootwait</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>]]></content>

    <updated>2015-07-08T04:47:04.000Z</updated>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I think we’re all still trying to figure out what Yo’s place is in the internet family but as of right now it’s basically a viral app. As soon as I found out there was an API for it I just knew I had to attach some hardware to it. Here’s a demo of what I put together.</p>
<p>The whole thing took me about 4 hours once I resolved my API issue (I originally gave them the wrong URL for the callback and had to email them to fix it). I want to share the process in case other people want to integrate Yo with hardware.</p>
<h1 style="text-align:center;"><img src="/img/port/yo_post.jpg" width="640" height="400"></h1>

<a id="more"></a>
<h2 id="Proof_It_Works">Proof It Works</h2><p><br></p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/9c45uJmmYs4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<h2 id="How_It_Works">How It Works</h2><p>You send a Yo to UCASTS to subscribe —-&gt; My live yo counter increments —-&gt; Anytime I push the magic button all of my subscribers get a Yo!.</p>
<p>In terms of hardware you can customize this process to do whatever you want.</p>
<ol>
<li>User subscribes to your Yo feed</li>
<li>A callback allows you to execute some action when someone subscribes</li>
<li>You now have the ability to easily send a Yo to all of your subscribers based on any trigger you can think of.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Understanding_the_API">Understanding the API</h2><p>To sign up for the API just head over to <a href="http://yoapi.justyo.co/" target="_blank" rel="external">http://yoapi.justyo.co/</a>. You’ll be walked through a few simple steps to get things set up. If you want notifications when people subscribe you’ll need to specify a callback url that the api can call. Once you’ve finished filling out the form you’ll have to wait for Yo to email you your api token. Mine took overnight but I didn’t register until later in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Once you have your api token all you have to do to send a Yo to all of your subscribers is POST your api token to <strong>api.justyo.co/yoall/</strong></p>
<figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">curl --data “api_token=[your_api_token]” http://api.justyo.co/yoall/</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>That’s all there is to it.</p>
<h2 id="The_Server">The Server</h2><p>So there are really two parts to this. We need a backend to handle the callback requests from the Yo api and a client running on the Pi to handle our hardware interaction. Let’s start with the server. This is really quite simple. I created an <a href="http://expressjs.com" target="_blank" rel="external">Express</a> website that I pushed to <a href="https://heroku.com" target="_blank" rel="external">Heroku</a> and then pointed one of my domains to it. In <a href="http://blog.microcasts.tv/2014/06/21/using-socket-io-to-control-the-raspberry-pi-remotely/" target="_blank" rel="external">&micro;Cast #17</a> I showed how to set up <a href="http://socket.io/download/" target="_blank" rel="external">Socket.IO</a> with Express and that’s all I did here with one change. Because the socket.io server reuses the regular express server I had to define a route in the <strong>www</strong> file which also meant I had to move the 404 and error handler there. Here’s what I ended up with in <strong>www</strong>.</p>

<p>So when a request to my callback url happens I simply emit a message to the client running on the Raspberry Pi.</p>
<h2 id="The_Pi_Client">The Pi Client</h2><p>The client piece of this project was fairly simple given the fact that I already had a display and button wired up on a breadboard and connected to a Pi. The first piece to the client is listening for websocket messages from the server to detect new subscribers. That’s as easy as:</p>
<figure class="highlight javascript"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">var</span> socket = <span class="built_in">require</span>(<span class="string">"socket.io-client"</span>)(<span class="string">'http://yo.microcasts.tv'</span>);</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">var</span> yoCount = <span class="number">0</span>;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">socket.on(<span class="string">'connect'</span>, <span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span>(<span class="params"></span>)</span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="built_in">console</span>.log(<span class="string">"Connected to server"</span>);</span><br><span class="line">  socket.on(<span class="string">'yoReceived'</span>, <span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span>(<span class="params">username</span>)</span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="comment">// Increment the yo count and update display</span></span><br><span class="line">    yoCount++;</span><br><span class="line">    updateDisplay(yoCount + <span class="string">""</span>);</span><br><span class="line">  &#125;);</span><br><span class="line">&#125;);</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>I’m using the <a href="https://www.npmjs.org/package/spi" target="_blank" rel="external">spi</a> package to connect to <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11442" target="_blank" rel="external">my display</a>. I don’t store the count anywhere locally at this point. I just count the Yos I’ve gotten since launching the program but it would be trivial to store that info and track your Yo total. Every time I get a new websocket message I just update the display.</p>
<figure class="highlight javascript"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">var</span> spi = <span class="keyword">new</span> SPI.Spi(<span class="string">'/dev/spidev0.0'</span>);</span><br><span class="line">spi.open();</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="title">updateDisplay</span>(<span class="params">text</span>)</span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">var</span> t = <span class="keyword">new</span> Buffer(text);</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">var</span> r = <span class="keyword">new</span> Buffer(text);</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">var</span> clearMsg = <span class="keyword">new</span> Buffer([<span class="number">0x76</span>]);</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">var</span> clearRx = <span class="keyword">new</span> Buffer([<span class="number">0x00</span>]);</span><br><span class="line">  spi.transfer(clearMsg, clearRx, <span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span>(<span class="params">dev, buf</span>)</span>&#123;&#125;);</span><br><span class="line">  spi.transfer(t, r, <span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span>(<span class="params">dev, buf</span>)</span>&#123;&#125;);</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>The final piece to the client is sending a Yo to all of my followers when I push a button. Since the API is so simple we can accomplish that with just 12 lines of code if we use <a href="https://www.npmjs.org/package/requestify" target="_blank" rel="external">Requestify</a>:</p>
<figure class="highlight javascript"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">var</span> gpio18 = gpio.export(<span class="number">24</span>, &#123;direction: <span class="string">'in'</span>, ready: <span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span>(<span class="params"></span>)</span>&#123;&#125;&#125;);</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">// Listen for button presses</span></span><br><span class="line">gpio18.on(<span class="string">'change'</span>, <span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span>(<span class="params">value</span>)</span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">if</span> (value === <span class="number">1</span>)&#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="built_in">console</span>.log(<span class="string">"You pressed the button"</span>);</span><br><span class="line">    requestify.post(<span class="string">'http://api.justyo.co/yoall/'</span>, &#123;</span><br><span class="line">      api_token: <span class="string">"[your token]"</span></span><br><span class="line">    &#125;)</span><br><span class="line">    .then(<span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span>(<span class="params">response</span>)</span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">      <span class="built_in">console</span>.log(<span class="string">"Yo sent to subscribers!"</span>);</span><br><span class="line">    &#125;);</span><br><span class="line">  &#125;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;);</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<h2 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>My one regret with this project was that I didn’t have one of these from Sparkfun on hand:</p>

<p>Got any ideas on how to integrate hardware with the Yo API? I’d love to here about it.</p>
<p><strong>If this article brought you any value at all I’d really appreciate it if you would share it</strong></p>

    <![CDATA[<p>I think we’re all still trying to figure out what Yo’s place is in the internet family but as of right now it’s basically a viral app. As soon as I found out there was an API for it I just knew I had to attach some hardware to it. Here’s a demo of what I put together.</p>
<p>The whole thing took me about 4 hours once I resolved my API issue (I originally gave them the wrong URL for the callback and had to email them to fix it). I want to share the process in case other people want to integrate Yo with hardware.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="TLDR">TLDR</h3><p>I created a python module that makes interacting with specific hardware easy. You can find it here:<br><a href="https://github.com/sidwarkd/ucasts_pi" target="_blank" rel="external">&micro;Casts Raspberry Pi Library</a></p>
<hr>

<p>I’ve found myself writing quite a bit of code lately to interface with different pieces of hardware on the Raspberry Pi. I finally realized that for every new project I was copying the same code from the previous project to do things like turn on an LED or read the state of a switch. I decided that it was time to take all of that work and put it into a library that I could easily reuse with each project.</p>
<h2 id="Simple_Example">Simple Example</h2><p>The python and node modules I’ve used to create projects in the past are very simple and generally easy to use. What they don’t provide, and aren’t meant to provide, is a higher level of abstraction around certain pieces of hardware. For example, let’s look at the <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11931" target="_blank" rel="external">TMP102 Sensor</a>.</p>
<p></p><h1 style="text-align:center;"><img src="/img/port/tmp102.jpg" width="300" height="300"></h1><p></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><small><em>TMP102 image provided by Sparkfun as <a style="color:red;" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/" target="_blank" rel="external">CC BY-NC-SA 3.0</a></em></small></p>

<a id="more"></a>
<p>It’s an I²C temperature sensor that will return a reading of the current temperature. But like any I²C module you need to know things like what registers to set and read to get that reading and how the reading is returned by the sensor. For this sensor the current reading is accessed via register 0x00 of the module and is returned as a 12-bit value which requires a two byte read. Then you have to know that the value you get back is an integer that needs to be multiplied by .0625 to get a reading in degrees Celsius. Here’s what the code looks like.</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">import</span> smbus</span><br><span class="line">bus = smbus.SMBus(<span class="number">1</span>)</span><br><span class="line">temp = bus.read_word_data(<span class="number">0x48</span>, <span class="number">0</span>)</span><br><span class="line">byte1_mask = <span class="number">0b0000000011111111</span></span><br><span class="line">byte2_mask = <span class="number">0b1111111100000000</span></span><br><span class="line">byte1 = (temp &amp; byte1_mask) &lt;&lt; <span class="number">4</span></span><br><span class="line">byte2 = (temp &amp; byte2_mask) &gt;&gt; <span class="number">12</span></span><br><span class="line">temp_c = byte2 | byte1</span><br><span class="line">temp_c *= .<span class="number">0625</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>Not overly complicated but it took some work and time reading through the datasheet. Now apply this to everything in your project; display, buttons, switches, etc.</p>
<h2 id="Gimme_the_Abstraction">Gimme the Abstraction</h2><p>What I wanted was to drop a module into my project that had all of this code I previously figured out wrapped up nicely and ready to use. So here is how I get a temperature reading from the TMP102 with the ucasts Raspberry Pi python module.</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">from</span> ucasts <span class="keyword">import</span> TMP102</span><br><span class="line">temp_sensor = TMP102()</span><br><span class="line">tempF = temp_sensor.get_temp_in_f()</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>The library handles the I²C bus and all other sensor-specific details. I’ve added a handful of components already and intend to expand it as I experiment with more modules for &micro;Cast episodes. I’ve tried to thoroughly document it so it’s easy to pick up and use.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/sidwarkd/ucasts_pi" target="_blank" rel="external">&micro;Casts Raspberry Pi Library</a></p>
<p>If you do use the library I’d love to hear about it and I’m always happy to answer any questions.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>[UPDATE]:</strong> I’ve had requests to post the finished code on Github for those that want to just play with the completed app. It’s now available at <a href="https://github.com/sidwarkd/pimonitor" target="_blank" rel="external">https://github.com/sidwarkd/pimonitor</a>.</p>
<p>About a month ago I came across the <a href="http://lifehacker.com/command-pi-monitors-your-raspberry-pi-from-your-phone-1561340630" target="_blank" rel="external">CommandPi</a> iOS app. It looked interesting so I paid the 99 cents and downloaded it to my iPad. The problem was, it didn’t work. I would provide my SSH credentials and after logging in the program would crash. So like any curious developer, instead of waiting for a fix I set out to write my own.</p>
<p>To be fair to the creator of <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/command-pi/id830462681?mt=8" target="_blank" rel="external">CommandPi</a>, what you are about to see is not meant to take anything away from that app. The app creator has put together a very nice UI and the crashing issue has been fixed. I just wanted to see how easy or hard it would be to create a knock off using <a href="http://expressjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">ExpressJS</a>, <a href="http://angularjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">Angular</a> and <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Bootstrap</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="/episodes/2014/03/15/memory-usage-on-the-raspberry-pi/">µCast #14</a> and <a href="/episodes/2014/03/20/cpu-usage-on-the-raspberry-pi/">µCast #15</a> we created the plumbing necessary to grab most of the information necessary to create our app. We also expose the <a href="/tips/2013/10/25/query-temperature-on-raspberry-pi/">temperature reading given by the Pi</a>. This episode was shot in a single take (with light editing for time) showing how to pull various technologies together to create a web application for monitoring our Raspberry Pi.</p>

<p>As part of my Skillshare class <a href="http://www.skillshare.com/classes/technology/Unleash-The-Raspberry-Pi-Through-Physical-Computing/2109089069" target="_blank" rel="external">Unleash The Raspberry Pi Through Physical Computing</a> I created a cheat sheet that I reference when working on hardware projects involving the Pi. </p>
<p>You may find it useful when working on your own projects so feel free to download and share. Let me know if you think I’m missing something important. I’m working on an HTML version and will update this post when it’s ready.</p>
