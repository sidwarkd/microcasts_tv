##Summary
The Clear Core Light Pipe from Sparkfun is basically a length of solid core plastic tubing that transmits light while "bleeding" light along the length. It can be used to "pop out" a status led from inside an enclosure to the exterior by shining the LED in one end and having light emitted from the other end. It's kind of like fiber optics but has the additional property that light leaks out all along the length kind of like a glow bracelet or necklace but not as bright. While pretty neat stuff for dark applications the glow effect is lacking when lights are on and is basically undetectable in sunlight conditions.

##Price
Priced about $5/ft seems a bit high for what is essentially a solid rubber-like cord.

##Quality
Not too much can go wrong with this stuff. It's unlikely to break unless you're really rough with it.

##As Advertised
Pretty much as advertised by Sparkfun although I do feel that it's not clear just how much the light dims out along the length. I was expecting the color to hold up more over the length of the pipe.

##Ease of Use
Pretty easy to cut but can be a little tricky to get an LED "mounted" to it. Sparkfun recommends using a piece of shrink tube which works well but if you don't have any you'll have a hard time mating it to an LED.
