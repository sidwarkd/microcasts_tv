If you've been paying attention to hardware lately you've probably noticed how people have gone insane over remotely accessing their devices. In this &micro;Cast I'll show you a simple way to get your project setup so that you can talk to it and control it via the interwebs. The best part, it only takes about 20 minutes.

We'll pull together all kinds of awesomeness using

  * [SocketIO][socket_io]
  * [Node][node]
  * [Express][express]
  * [Heroku][heroku] by using the [Heroku Toolbelt][heroku_toolbelt]
  * [jQuery][jquery]
  * and more
