In this &micro;Cast I'll show you how to take an old wall adapter and turn it into a cheap power supply that can be used to provide power to some of your projects.

<div class="tip">Use an old adapter from a phone or other device that no longer works. If you don't have one lying around hit your local thrift shop and pick a few up for under a dollar.
