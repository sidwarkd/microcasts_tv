##Theory -- Light Version
At &micro;Casts we're not trying to give you an in-depth academic understanding of electrical engineering principles.  We just want to give you enough information to rock your awesome project and be safe doing it.  For that reason, the intro to Ohm's Law in this video is very very simple.  Ohm's law can be very complicated.  Trust me, I still have college homework problems to prove my point.  Anyway, the purpose of this video was to give you a head's up that voltage, current, and resistance all relate to each other.  Fully understanding that relationship can take years of just letting things soak in but for now just know that there are two important equations that we might be using from time to time.  They are:
